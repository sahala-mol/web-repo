Muthoot takes its name from its Family, which is a branch of a traditional Orthodox Christian family, based in Kozhencherry, a small town in the erstwhile primary state of Travancore (Kerala). In the year 1887, Muthoot Ninan Mathai (Patron Founder of the group), started in a humble way as a retail and whole-sale trader of grains at Kozhencherry. The family partition took place in the year 1979 which led to the Genesis of Muthoot George Group (MGG).
